# github-jenkins-integration-CICD-

Here i am adding a video with description on how to build jenkins pipeline which connects to github and pulls the script from there and  passes parameters from jenkins
to script and uses cygwin.exe shell to eecute script on my local laptop.

I have also attached the jenkins file responsible for doing all the actions in pipeline manner.
